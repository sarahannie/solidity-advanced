# Account-Abstraction

This is the fourth project in Solidity-Advanced, in this project I created a simple wallet application. This project showcases a smart wallet system that enables users to generate multiple wallets as required and allocate funds to them. The project's focal point is the incorporation of the Account Abstraction proposal (EIP-4337) for its implementation.
