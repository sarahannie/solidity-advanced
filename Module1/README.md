# Vesting-Project

This is the first project in Solidity-Advanced, in this project I created a simple vesting application. This implements a vesting mechanism that gradually disburses tokens to stakeholders within a defined timeframe. It empowers organizations to establish stakeholders, define vesting durations, and authorize specific addresses for token retrievals.
